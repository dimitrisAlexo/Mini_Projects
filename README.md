C/C++/Java projects, as well as some notes:
1. TowerDefense: game in Java - uncompleted - stable
2. MinimaxWithPruning: Java shortening algorithm with AB pruning as part of the coursework for the course "Data Structures"
3. Maze: graphics game in Java
4. CosmoNuts: project in C++ with which we qualified for the NASA SpaceApps Challenge in 2020
5. assembly: two assembly programs that I made as part of the "Computer Organization" course; one is the quicksort algorithm and the second is the multiplication of floating point numbers
6. openGL: source code from a simple graphics program in OpenGL; athough extremely hard to use, it helped me better understand low level programming
7. Notes and Tips for PCB Design: my notes for designing PCBs
8. PCBDesign: the schematic and PCB for a programmable board which controls via a microcontroller RGB Led Lights and accelerometer - EasyEDA used
